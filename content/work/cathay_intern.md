An 8-week internship at the __New Technology Exploration team__.

Worked on the following projects:
* __CI/CD Introductory Course__:
Wrote a self-study course for newcomers to familiarise themselves with the public cloud operations and DevOps practices at Cathay Pacific. Developed a core understanding of cloud computing, DevOps and technologies within the DevOps stack (Jenkins, OpenShift, Kibana).

* __DeepLens Exploration__:
Explored the possibility of integrating AWS DeepLens into a business use case for Cathay Pacific operations. Studied the general cloud computing concept and the specific IoT and edge computing solutions from AWS in IoT Core and Greengrass respectively. Worked with the actual DeepLens device to develop a Python Lambda that achieves on-device face detection and sentiment analysis.

* __Hackathon Portal__:
Participated in agile software development as a developer in the scrum team. Refined technical skills through building backend RESTful services for the admin panel and QR event registration, writing scripts for automating production-build tasks using Gulp and working on the event registration QR scanner iOS app. Applied the Scrum framework throughout the two 2-week sprints, from discussing story points during sprint planning to reflections during sprint retrospectives.

* __Cathay Moments__:
Revamped the main activity view of the Android app to complement the existing iOS version and implement dynamic content rendering based on data stored on AWS S3.

* __SeatCX__:
Worked with another 3 interns in applying design thinking methodologies to develop a customer-facing solution for Cathay Pacific. Identified existing pain points of swapping seats on board, developed a functional prototype of a seat-swapping portal using websockets and presented the solution to an audience of interns and managers.

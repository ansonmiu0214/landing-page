Project: __Feeds Handler Code Generator__

* Spearheaded migration to a Python codebase for leveraging Jinja to decouple templates from logic.
* Presented to developers and managers in London and New York offices; received the go-ahead and built upon feedback.
* Collaborated with Feed Developers to pilot the tool for the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange Feed Handler project.
* Designed a modular mechanism for incremental code generation to provide a flexible experience for developers.
* Proactively took part in training courses to learn about new technologies and their roles in other parts of the company.
* Studied C++ move semantics through training courses; adopted this for optimising the generated code to reduce latency.

Leveraged knowledge in __Python__ (data model, metaprogramming),
__C++__ and __API design__.

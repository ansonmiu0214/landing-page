    title: About
    content: |-
      I am a final year Computing student at Imperial College London.
      Upon completing my studies, I will be joining Bloomberg in their
      London offices as a Graduate Software Engineer.
      
      I am particularly interested in __type systems__ and __programming
      language design__.
      My master's thesis focuses on implementing multiparty session types 
      (a behavioural typing discipline) for interactive web applications
      written in TypeScript.

      Outside of programming, I enjoy going on road trips around the 
      countryside - thankfully, driving seems to be compatible with the
      post-COVID-19 world!
